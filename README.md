# Friends List App

### Summary
The goal of this project is to create a working friends list, as you would see in a game, or on Steam. This will be a small server-client app, where the client is the one requesting the server via TCP sockets to search for users, as well as add, remove, and invite them to games. The server must be able to store all of it's user data in a database. First the app will start out only on localhost, but then will set the server up on my old laptop to hopefully work from anywhere.

### Goals, in order of importance:
1. Users can request to see their current friends list
2. Users can search for other users via unique gamer tag
3. Users can send a friend request to a user to add them to their friends list, if the receiving user accepts.
4. User can view pending friend requests.
5. User can remove friends from friend list
6. User can see if their friends are online
7. User can invite friends to join them in a 'game' (simulated for this project) if they are online
8. User can message other friends
