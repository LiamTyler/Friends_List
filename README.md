# Friends List App

### Summary
The goal of this project is to create a working friends list, as you would see in a game, or on Steam. This will be a small server-client app, where the client is the one requesting the server via TCP sockets to search for users, as well as add, remove, and invite them to games. The server must be able to store all of it's user data in a database. I am using Postgres for this. First the app will start out only on localhost, but then will set the server up on my old laptop to hopefully work from anywhere.

### Features
- Add / remove Users
- Send / accept / reject / view friend requests
- Remove friends
- View friendslist
- Set Online / In game status

### Progress
All of the features described above work just fine. I lost interest in making this an actual usable app, but it was the first time I used a database API, so it was nice to learn a little about that.
